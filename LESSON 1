What is Game Theory?
---
Game Theory is a method of studying strategic situation, where the outcomes that affect you depend on actions,not just on your own actions, but on the actions of others. Everything that constitutes imperfect competition is stategic situation.
Game Theory constructs mathematical models to examine how people behave in strategic(战略上的) situations.


***APPLICATION:***

 - Economics
 - Psychology
 - Political Science
 - Sociology
 - Biology
 - Computer Science

Modelling social problems as a "Game"
---

***Ad hoc Approach***  : Depending on each problem, you use your intuition and get your answer.


**Common ground of social problems**

 - individuals try to do their best against others
 - under certain set of rules


**Three elements of the game mathematical model**

 - Players
 - Strategy
 - Payoff

In search for the Governing Principle
---

If intelligent agents are trying to predict each other's behaviour and maximise their payoff, we end up with the infinite regress problem.

Concerns about a mathematical theory of Human Behavior

Prediction by mathematical formula

 - Free will defeats any attempt to predict human behavior by a math formula
 - You can just ask them why they did it
 - I have never seen or heard that game theory works


***Why do we need the game theory, rather than the theory of maximization, to analyze a strategic situation?***
Because we need an additional theory to analyze how one player anticipates the other players' behavior
